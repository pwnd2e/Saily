## Compiling Project

For debugging with Xcode, there is nothing to setup for, just open the workspace and click run. Certifications and bundle identity are required to be changed in purpose of real device debugging. Debugging build will not include license info which is scanned and generated while compiling for release build.

For releasing/jailbroken compile, exeucte command line inside resources folder. Make sure to install dpkg, for building the package, and python3 for license scanning, xcpretty for a better output format. swiftlint and bartycrouch are optional.
